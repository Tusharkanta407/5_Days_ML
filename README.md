# 5 Days ML Learning Journey 🚀

## About This Journey
Hello everyone! I'm Tushar, and after a lot of procrastination, inconsistency, and carelessness, I'm planning to complete ML in 5 days. I know it sounds funny, but it has become necessary for me because if I procrastinate more, I'm going to fall behind. The world is changing rapidly with AI products and multiple things shipping faster, so I need to step out of my web development comfort zone.

I'm not doing every Kaggle project, but whatever I learn, I'll try to implement. You can mock me about how I can complete ML in 5 days - I'm not claiming to master it completely, just going through the essentials. I'm dedicating 6 hours each day for 5 days, focusing on the important concepts rather than going deep into LLM/DL/AI specifics. Whatever I learn, I'm documenting here.
